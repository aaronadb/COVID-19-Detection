# COVID-19-Detection
This repository discusses a method used to detect COVID 19, from chest X-Ray images and CT scan images.
A model using transfer learning and stacking is used to predict whether a patient is COVID positive or negative.
Five datasets consisting of CT scan images as well as chest X-Ray images are used to train and test the model.
